## Current State of Development
The current code has been shifted to another machine following complications with the old machine, and due to *even more* complications when trying to transfer all files from the old machine to the new one, the database file was not able to be transfered with it.

As a result, any customizations made (log channels, modlog settings, custom prefixes, welcome messages, etc.) have been reset and will need to be set again.
