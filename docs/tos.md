# Terms and Rules
## Last updated: 3/11/2022

While Kit controls most rate limits and usage independantly, some terms still apply when using the bot.

By using Kit, you aknowledge all terms written out in the [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/2tuu/Kit/blob/master/docs/privacy.md).

# Usage
As stated before, most improper usage is rendered impossible by safeguards built into Kit itself, but this doesn't mean no rules apply to it.

Any attempts to spam commands, or any other functions however, will be picked up by the bot. If continued, it will result in action taken against your account.

## User-Generated Reports
Kit's bug reporting function (usable through k?bugreport) is meant for sending reports regarding flaws in Kit's design or otherwise dysfunctional code. 
Improper use, spam, or harassment directed through this function will not be tolerated.

## User-Generated Profiles and Notes
While user notes and profiles are not actively monitored, their content will still be held up to the standards every other discord message is.
If a profile or a note is reported by another user, and is found to contain any unwanted content, it will be removed.

Unwanted content may include:
- Slurs
- Targetted harassment
- Links or references to obscene content
- Anything violating Discord's terms of service

# Violations
Punishment for any violations of the terms listed above will result in anything between a verbal warning, or an addition to the blacklist.

Being added to the bot's blacklist means any and all interactions with the bot will be ignored by it; Commands will not work, settings cannot be adjusted, etc.
