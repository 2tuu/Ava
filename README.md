 ## Kit Bot
 A basic moderation bot for discord

 ## Running
 If you want to use the bot, invite it with the link below. I would prefer you didn't run your own instance; mostly because one already exists, but no support will be given to you for them, and the bot will quickly become out of date

## Documentation
Command documentation is available within the `k?help` command

## Command Aliases
Some commands have aliases, they are included in the conf export at the end of every command
When entere, they should look like this
**Aliases:**

```js
exports.conf = {
    DM: true,
    OwnerOnly: false,
    alias: ['alias1', 'alias2', 'alias3']
}
```
