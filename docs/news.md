## Note
Due to the implimentation of slash commands requiring extra authorization, any server currently using Kit who wishes to enable them will need to authorize it

You can do this by simply clicking the invite link provided by the k?invite command again, or using the link on https://2tu.dev/kit

**OR clicking the invite button that appears in Kit's user profile**

This will also authorize Kit with any permissions it requires to function normally, so if you're having any permissions related issues this will fix it

## Current State of Development
Hi all,

Got everything figured out with Discord and got Kit approved for the intents she didn't have before; this means custom prefixes and mod log modules will continue to function as they have been (in theory)

Slash commands *have* been implimented but while bot will continue to function just fine without them
I will be implimenting them with all commands in the future where applicable

If you run into any issues from now on with slash commands or any new codebase changes, please send a message in the support discord (in Kit's user profile), or submit a detailed report using k?reportbug and I'll try to get back to you

Note: Bug report replies cannot be sent unless Kit has permission to send DMs to you, so if you have DMs turned off in the server or unless Discord changes how that works in the future, you'll have to have them enabled to receive replies

Additionally, Kit now has a privacy policy laying out how message content is used, as per Discord's new rules regarding that - It is available by either checking the 'docs' folder in the github repo, or by clicking the link at the bottom of the 'help' command

Thanks,
Kab
